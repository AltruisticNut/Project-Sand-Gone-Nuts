TIPS AND NOTES FOR "GONE NUTS"
------------------------------

An extended list of what's been added to the vanilla game, what it does, and some extra info.
+ Draw canvas size enlarged, may cause lag but I like the bigger space.
+ UI has been slightly altered to accommodate this and look a bit nicer.
+ Pen Size, Spigot Type, and Spigot Sizes also have been updated with more values and element options.
+ Keybinds have been added for certain actions, including:
  + "Space" toggles the Overwrite check.
  + "Z" saves the current canvas.
  + "X" loads the last saved canvas.
  + "C" clears the canvas.
  + "A" sets the speed slider to 0.
  + "S" sets the speed slider to the default FPS (60).
  + "D" sets the speed slider to the max FPS (120).
+ The Elements Table has been updated, now containing vanilla elements that resulted from combining and/or interactions with multiple elements. These include:
  + Charged Nitro
  + Branch
  + Leaf
  + Pollen
  + Salt Water
  + Steam
  + Falling Wax
  + Rock
  + Wet Soil
  + Cryo Ice (Chilled Ice)
+ It has also been updated with a few of my own elements, including:
  + **Corrupt**: A purple, infectious element that will slowly spread to most organic/nature type elements. Doesn't do well spreading up, but can decimate a area if allowed.
  + **Firework**: A blue powder that spreads red, white and blue glory. Uses the FIRE_BLUE and FIRE_BRIGHT elements in it's particle, which is basically just nerfed and copied fire.
  + **Bedrock**: A stronger wall. Immune to lava and cursed fire, and acid in a future update.
  + **Snow**: Slow falling frozen water. Turns any place into a winter wonderland (or a pond if melted).
  + **Cursed Fire**: Not even water can put out the flame. Burns through most elements at a fixed rate, doesn't spread quite as easily as fire.
  + **Humans**: Little dudes who wander around, try not to stand on each other, and try to climb whatever they can and get killed in all sorts of ways. Kinda unfinished, hoping to do more, but they're fun to watch move.
  + **Nanites**: Clone whatever they come into contact with.
  + **Spice of Life**: An extremely chaotic explosive. Incorporates napalm, nitro, C-4, lava explosions, charged nitro, fireworks, and some cursed fire as well. All in one, tight package.
  + **Reproduction**: A fire-esque tool used to get humans to repopulate. Can also grow plant, branch, leaf. Best used with overwrite disabled.
+ Other elements, functions, and particles have been added to help these new elements operate.
+ No compatibility with acid or thermite yet. I just updated from a year old version and still need to fix stuff with it.
+ New bugs to discover, and ones I already know about (such as particle troubles with fireworks and such.).
